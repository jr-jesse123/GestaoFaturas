# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Client Responsible Person CRUD
> Created: 2025-09-02
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement CRUD operations for managing responsible persons associated with clients in the invoice management system. This feature will allow telecom analysts to maintain contact information and assign responsibility for invoice oversight, enabling better communication and accountability in the invoice management workflow.

## User Stories

### Responsible Person Management

As a telecom analyst, I want to add, edit, and remove responsible persons for each client, so that I can maintain accurate contact information and ensure proper invoice oversight accountability.

The user can navigate to a client's detail page and manage a list of responsible persons, including their contact details, role/title, and primary contact designation. Each responsible person includes name, email, phone, role, and a flag indicating if they are the primary contact for invoice-related communications.

### Primary Contact Assignment

As a telecom analyst, I want to designate a primary responsible person for each client, so that automated notifications and communications are sent to the correct contact.

The system allows setting one responsible person as primary per client, with automatic email routing for invoice status updates and billing discrepancy alerts to the designated primary contact.

## Spec Scope

1. **Responsible Person Entity** - Create data model with name, email, phone, role, and primary contact flag
2. **CRUD Interface** - Add, edit, delete, and list responsible persons within client management pages  
3. **Primary Contact Logic** - Designate and manage one primary contact per client with validation
4. **Client Integration** - Integrate responsible person management into existing client detail views
5. **Contact Validation** - Validate email format and ensure primary contact uniqueness per client

## Out of Scope

- Email notification system integration (will be implemented in future phases)
- Bulk import/export of responsible person data
- Advanced role-based permissions for responsible person access
- Integration with external contact management systems

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional CRUD interface for responsible persons accessible from client detail pages in the browser
2. Database properly stores and retrieves responsible person data with proper client associations
3. Primary contact designation works correctly with validation preventing multiple primary contacts per client
