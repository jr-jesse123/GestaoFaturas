# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Client Management CRUD Operations
> Created: 2025-09-01
> Status: Planning

## Overview

Implement comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for client management to allow telecom analysts to manage client company information, tax details, and contact data. This feature provides the foundation for invoice tracking by establishing proper client data management with validation and audit trails.

## User Stories

### Client Registration and Management

As a telecom analyst, I want to add new client companies with their tax identification and contact information, so that I can properly categorize and track invoices by client.

The analyst accesses a client management interface where they can input company details including business name, trade name, tax ID (CNPJ/CPF), contact information, and address. The system validates tax ID format and ensures uniqueness before creating the client record with audit timestamps.

### Client Information Updates

As a telecom analyst, I want to edit existing client information when company details change, so that I can maintain accurate and up-to-date client records.

The analyst can search for existing clients, select a specific client, and modify their information including contact details, address, or company names. All changes are tracked with timestamps and the system validates data before saving updates.

### Client Status Management

As a telecom analyst, I want to deactivate clients instead of deleting them, so that I can maintain data integrity for historical invoices while preventing new invoice assignments.

The analyst can mark clients as inactive/active, which removes them from active client lists but preserves all historical data and relationships with existing invoices.

## Spec Scope

1. **Client Creation** - Add new clients with company information, tax ID validation, and contact details
2. **Client Listing** - Display paginated list of clients with search and filter capabilities
3. **Client Details View** - Show comprehensive client information including associated cost centers
4. **Client Updates** - Edit client information with validation and audit tracking
5. **Client Status Management** - Activate/deactivate clients while preserving data integrity

## Out of Scope

- Client deletion (only deactivation is allowed to preserve data integrity)
- Bulk client import/export functionality
- Client financial analytics or reporting
- Integration with external tax ID validation services
- Client user authentication or portal access

## Expected Deliverable

1. A fully functional client management interface accessible from the main dashboard with create, read, update operations
2. Client list page with pagination, search, and filtering that displays active clients by default
3. Client detail view showing company information, contact details, and associated cost centers with edit capabilities
