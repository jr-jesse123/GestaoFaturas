# Spec Requirements Document

> Spec: Database Schema Design and Setup
> Created: 2025-08-31

## Overview

Design and implement a comprehensive PostgreSQL database schema with Entity Framework Core for a telecom invoice management system. This foundational infrastructure will support cost center management, invoice tracking, and automated workflow processing while ensuring data integrity and performance at scale.

## User Stories

### System Administrator Database Setup

As a system administrator, I want to initialize a properly structured database, so that the application can efficiently store and manage invoice data across multiple cost centers and clients.

The administrator will use Entity Framework Core migrations to create the initial database schema, including all tables, relationships, indexes, and constraints. The schema will support multi-tenant data isolation through cost center segmentation while maintaining referential integrity across all entities. This setup process will include seed data for initial system configuration and validation rules specific to telecom invoice processing.

### Developer Database Management

As a developer, I want to work with a well-designed domain model, so that I can implement business logic without worrying about database complexities.

The developer will interact with the database through Entity Framework Core's fluent API and domain entities that accurately represent the business model. The schema will support complex queries for reporting, efficient bulk operations for invoice imports, and optimized indexes for common search patterns. All database operations will be abstracted through the repository pattern with unit of work for transaction management.

## Spec Scope

1. **Core Entity Models** - Define domain entities for Clients, Cost Centers, Invoices, and Responsible Persons with proper relationships
2. **Database Configuration** - Configure PostgreSQL database with Entity Framework Core including connection strings and migration setup
3. **Relationship Mapping** - Establish foreign key relationships, cascade rules, and navigation properties between entities
4. **Index Strategy** - Create indexes for performance optimization on frequently queried columns and composite keys
5. **Seed Data** - Provide initial configuration data including invoice statuses, user roles, and system settings

## Out of Scope

- User interface for database management
- API endpoints for data access
- Authentication and authorization implementation
- Data migration from existing systems
- Backup and recovery procedures

## Expected Deliverable

1. Functional PostgreSQL database accessible through Entity Framework Core with all tables created and relationships established
2. Successful execution of initial migration creating complete schema with proper constraints and indexes
3. Domain models correctly mapped to database tables with navigation properties enabling LINQ queries
4. Integration Tetst ensure we can create, insert and query data in testcontainer database.
