## The Problem

### Manual Invoice Tracking

Telecom analysts currently track invoices using spreadsheets or disparate systems, leading to missed invoices and delayed processing. This results in late payment fees and inability to dispute incorrect charges within vendor deadlines.

**Our Solution:** Centralized invoice tracking system with automated status updates and notifications.

### Billing Anomaly Detection

Identifying invoices that exceed expected ranges requires manual comparison and analysis. Organizations lose thousands of dollars monthly due to undetected billing errors.

**Our Solution:** Automated range validation with flagging system for invoices requiring analysis.

### Communication Gaps

Cost center managers often remain uninformed about invoice status and issues. This leads to budget overruns and delayed corrective actions.

**Our Solution:** Automated email notifications at each invoice processing stage.
