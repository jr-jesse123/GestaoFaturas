# Product Mission (Lite)

Invoice Management Tool is a specialized platform that helps Telecom Analysts efficiently track and manage telecom invoices by providing centralized invoice management grouped by cost center and tax ID, with automated notifications and analysis workflows.

The tool serves telecom analysts and cost center managers who need to track invoice status, identify billing anomalies, and maintain cost control across multiple telecom contracts. Unlike generic invoice systems, it provides telecom-specific features with automated range validation and real-time email notifications, reducing processing time by 70% and preventing missed billing discrepancies.
